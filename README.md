- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS Library

### What I learned

I learnt how to integrate API in a Sveltekit project, using Fetch API. I also learnt how to render this API data

### Continued development

I would like to learn more about routing and state management in Svelte. Working on a more complex project using Svelte is what I look forward to next
